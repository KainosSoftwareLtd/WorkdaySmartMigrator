# migrator docker

To run migrator docker you need to:

* pull `lukasz/migrator` from docker cloud
* mount a volume with migrations under `/data`
* (optional) specify location of migrator configuration file via environmental variable `MIGRATOR_YAML`, defaults to `/data/migrator.yaml`

To run migrator as a service:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /Users/lukasz/migrator-test:/data -e MIGRATOR_YAML=/data/m.yaml -d --link migrator-postgres lukasz/migrator
Starting migrator using config file: /data/m.yaml
2016/08/04 06:24:58 Read config file ==> OK
2016/08/04 06:24:58 Migrator web server starting on port 8080...
```

To run migrator in interactive terminal mode:

```bash
docker run -it -v /Users/lukasz/migrator-test:/data --entrypoint sh --link migrator-postgres lukasz/migrator
```

# History and releases

Here is a short history of migrator docker images:

1. initial release in 2016 - migrator on debian:jessie - 603MB
2. v1.0 - migrator v1.0 on golang:1.11.2-alpine3.8 - 346MB
3. v1.0-mini - migrator v1.0 multi-stage build with final image on alpine:3.8 - 13.4MB
4. v2.0 - migrator v2.0 - 14.8MB

Starting with v2.0 all migrator images by default use multi-stage builds. For migrator v1.0 you have to explicitly use `v1.0-mini` tag in order to enjoy an ultra lightweight migrator image. Still, I recommend using latest and greatest.

Finally, starting with v2.0 migrator-docker project was merged into migrator main project. New version of docker image is built automatically every time a new release is created.
