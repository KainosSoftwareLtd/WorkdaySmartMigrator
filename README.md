# Migrator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/migrator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/migrator)

DB migration tool written in go.

# Usage

Short and sweet.

```
$ migrator -h
Usage of migrator:
  -action string
    	migrator action to apply, valid actions are: ["apply" "listDiskMigrations" "listDBTenants" "listDBMigrations"] (default "apply")
  -configFile string
    	path to migrator.yaml (default "migrator.yaml")
  -verbose
    	set to "true" to print more data to output
```

Migrator requires a simple `migrator.yaml` file:

```
baseDir: test/migrations
driver: postgres
dataSource: "user=postgres dbname=migrator_test host=192.168.99.100 port=55432 sslmode=disable"
# override only if you have own specific way of determining tenants
tenantsSql: "select name from public.migrator_tenants"
singleSchemas:
  - public
  - ref
  - config
tenantSchemas:
  - tenants
```

Migrator will scan all directories under `baseDir` directory. Migrations listed under `singleSchemas` directories will be applied once. Migrations listed under `tenantSchemas` directories will be applied for all tenants fetched using `tenantsSql`.

SQL migrations in both `singleSchemas` and `tenantsSchemas` can use `{schema}` placeholder which is automatically replaced by migrator to the current schema. For example:

```
create table if not exists {schema}.modules ( k int, v text );
insert into {schema}.modules values ( 123, '123' );
```

# Supported databases

Currently migrator supports the following databases:

* PostgreSQL - schema-based multi-tenant database, with transactions spanning DDL statements
* MySQL - database-based multi-tenant database, transactions do not span DDL statements
* MariaDB - enhanced near linearly scalable multi-master MySQL

# Examples

PostgreSQL:

```
$ docker/postgresql-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ ./coverage.sh
$ docker/postgresql-destroy-container.sh
```

MySQL:

```
$ docker/mysql-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ ./coverage.sh
$ docker/mysql-destroy-container.sh
```

MariaDB:

```
$ docker/mariadb-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ ./coverage.sh
$ docker/mariadb-destroy-container.sh
```

Or see `.travis.yml` to see how it's done on Travis.
