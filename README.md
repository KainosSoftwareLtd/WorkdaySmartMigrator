# Migrator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/migrator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukaszbudnik/migrator)

DB migration tool written in go.

# Usage

Short and sweet. Migrator requires a simple `migrator.yaml` file:

```
baseDir: test/migrations
driver: postgres
dataSource: "user=postgres dbname=migrator_test host=192.168.99.100 port=55432 sslmode=disable"
# override only if you have own specific way of determining tenants
tenantsSql: "select name from public.migrator_tenants"
singleSchemas:
  - public
  - ref
  - config
tenantSchemas:
  - tenants
```

Migrator will scan all directories under `baseDir` directory. Migrations listed under `singleSchemas` will be applied once. Migrations listed under `tenantSchemas` will be applied for all tenants fetched using `tenantsSql`.

# Supported databases

Currently migrator supports the following databases:

* PostgreSQL - true multitenant database, with transactions spanning DDL statements
* MySQL - pseudo multitenant database, transactions do not span DDL statements
* MariaDB - enhanced MySQL

# Examples

PostgreSQL:

```
$ docker/postgresql-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ go test -v
$ docker/postgresql-destroy-container.sh
```

MySQL:

```
$ docker/mysql-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ go test -v
$ docker/mysql-destroy-container.sh
```

MariaDB:

```
$ docker/mariadb-create-and-setup-container.sh
$ go test -v
$ docker/mariadb-destroy-container.sh
```

Or see `.travis.yml` to see how it's done on Travis.
